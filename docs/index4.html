			<p class="intro"> It goes without saying that the pandemic has disrupted our lives. It has restructured how we work, socialize, and cultivate community. It has also exacerbated long-standing prevalent issues such as food insecurity, or the lack of access to fresh, nutritional foods due to location, socioeconomic status, among other reasons.</p>

			<p> Here in New York City, the Bronx has the highest rate of food insecurity in the boroughs, with nearly 230,000 residents facing some form of it. This not just an urban issue, either. In more rural areas like Mississippi, food insecurity still runs rampant, effecting over 700,000 residents. </p>

			<p> And as you can imagine, a global pandemic hasn‚Äôt helped much. Feeding America, an organization dedicated to addressing food insecurity in the United States, projected that more than 42 million people, 13 million of which are children, experienced food insecurity in 2020 due to COVID-19. Additionally, by May 2020 nearly 20.5 million people filed for unemployment, and when unemployment rises so do people's ability to afford food.</p>


			<p> Perhaps lesser known consquences of the pandemic include disrupted food production and food shortages, compounding how communities experience food insecurity. With all fo this in mind, So what can be done? </p>

			<p> In recent years, community gardens have gained traction in cities across the United States. They serve as  green spaces for communities to grow their own fresh and healthy food, learn about urban agriculture, and organize and advocate for themselves  as a community. Gil Lopez, an urban farmer and guerilla gardener from Western Queens, spoke at length about how community gardens function as a democratic and collaborative space.</p>

					<figcaption class="graphic-text">Community gardens offer a space for members to grow fresh food. This is especially useful for communities living in food deserts, where affordable and nutritional food is difficult to come by. This is useful in mitigating the effects of both covid-related and general food insecurities, as well as improving the overall health of communities.

					<h4>Agricultural education</h4>
					<img src="learn.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text"> Acting as spaces of education, the ability to teach participants how to plant, tend, and harvest these crops is an invaluable skill. Community members will be able to learn more about the business and production of urban agriculture, leaning to broader economic opportunities. When communities have the know-how to grow their own food sustainably, it combats the effects of food deserts and strengthens a community‚Äôs sense of autonomy.

					<h4>Mental & physical health </h4>

					<figcaption class="graphic-text">Access to green spaces, in general, especially in a concrete jungle like New York City, has a significant impact on the mental and physical well being. Working in or on a community garden can help reduce stress, mitigate pollution, and encourage people to engage in physical activity they may not otherwise get.

Although the pandemic has stripped many of their social networks, or rendered them digital, community gardens have allowed people to socialize and deepen community ties during the pandemic.

			<p>While urban gardening initiatives can do a lot of good for communities, they aren‚Äôt the sole answer to combating food insecurity. As we‚Äôve seen, the lack of access to nutritious food did not start with the pandemic and will not end when it does. It is a larger, systemic issue that cannot be addressed by small pockets of communities across the nation. It demands the attention of institutions and policymakers. </p>

			<p>However, community gardens have provided a space for urban agriculture, advocacy, improved physical and mental wellbeing, and most importantly to grow food. It is not the end all be all, but it is a start. As people begin to assess what a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù means to them, community gardens‚Äôs contribution to  people‚Äôs lives should be included in that conversation. </p>
